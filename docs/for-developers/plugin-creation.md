# Plugin Creation Guide

This guide provides a complete walkthrough for creating a new plugin, adding it to the Zsh Supercharge (`zsc`) plugin store, and maintaining it over time.

Ah, got it! üëç We don‚Äôt need to enforce a fixed `<plugin-id>.plugin.zsh` name‚Äîcontributors can name their entry point whatever they want, since `zsc` reads it from `plugin.json`.

Here‚Äôs the corrected **plugin directory tree section**:

## Recommended Plugin Directory Structure

Each plugin should follow this layout:

```
<plugin-repo>/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md              # Optional, but recommended
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE                # Should be included and have MPL-2.0 license
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ plugin.json            # Required metadata for the plugin
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ <entry-point>.zsh      # Entry point script (name can vary, must match plugin.json)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/                # Optional folder for images or other assets
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

**Example:**

```
zsh-modern-theme/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ plugin.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ modern-theme.zsh              # Entry point script, name from plugin.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ screenshots/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dark-theme.png
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ light-theme.png
```

> **Note:** The `plugin.json` file must include the plugin ID, name, author, email, description, and the entry point filename. Lazy/async flags are optional.

### Step 1: Create Your Plugin Repository

Before adding your plugin to `zsc`, it must exist in its own Git repository.

1.  **Create a new repository on GitHub.**
2.  **Clone the repository to your local machine.**
3.  **Create your plugin files.** At a minimum, you'll need an entry point file (e.g., `entry.zsh`).
4.  **Create a `plugin.json` file.** You can do this manually, or you can use the `zsc` `init` tool to generate one for you (see the next section).
5.  **Commit and push your changes.**

### Step 2: Add Your Plugin to `zsc` as a Submodule

Once your plugin is in its own repository, you can add it to the `zsc` plugin store as a submodule.

1.  **Clone the `zsc` repository.**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/badrat-in/zsc.git
    cd zsc
    ```

2.  **Add your plugin as a submodule.** Use the `git submodule add` command, followed by your plugin's repository URL and the path where you want to add it (`plugins/<your-plugin-id>`).

    ```bash
    git submodule add https://github.com/your-username/your-plugin.git plugins/your-plugin-id
    ```

3.  **Generate a `plugin.json` file (if you haven't already).** The `init` tool will create a `plugin.json` file in the correct directory.

    ```bash
    yarn init
    ```

    Follow the prompts to enter your plugin's information. When it asks for the **Plugin ID**, make sure it matches the directory name you used in the `git submodule add` command.

4.  **Commit the submodule addition.**

    ```bash
    git add .gitmodules plugins/<your-plugin-id>
    git commit -m "feat: Add <your-plugin-id> plugin"
    ```

5.  **Push your changes to your fork and open a pull request.**

### Step 3: Updating Your Plugin

To update a plugin that has already been added to `zsc`, you need to update the submodule to point to the latest commit in your plugin's repository.

1.  **Navigate to your plugin's directory** within the `zsc` repository.

    ```bash
    cd plugins/<your-plugin-id>
    ```

2.  **Pull the latest changes** from your plugin's repository.

    ```bash
    git pull origin main
    ```

3.  **Return to the root of the `zsc` repository.**

    ```bash
    cd ../..
    ```

4.  **Commit the updated submodule.**

    ```bash
    git add plugins/<your-plugin-id>
    git commit -m "feat: Update <your-plugin-id> plugin"
    ```

5.  **Push your changes and open a pull request.**
