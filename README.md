# Zsh Supercharge

**A fast, flexible, and user-friendly plugin manager for Zsh.**

Zsh Supercharge (`zsc`) is a next-generation plugin manager for Zsh that is designed to be fast, flexible, and easy to use. It provides powerful features for both users and developers, including dependency management, schema validation, and lazy loading.

This repository serves as the official plugin store and development hub for `zsc`.

## üñ•Ô∏è Supported OS

Currently, `zsc` is developed and tested primarily on **macOS (Apple Silicon)**. Support for other platforms is on the roadmap.

## ‚ú® Features

-   [x] **Schema-Driven:** Plugins are defined by a `plugin.json` file, which is validated against a schema.
-   [x] **Dependency Management:** Automatically install and manage dependencies for your plugins (Brew packages, other plugins).
-   [x] **Asynchronous Loading:** Plugins are loaded asynchronously by default to keep your prompt responsive.
-   [x] **Lazy Loading:** Defer plugin loading until they are actually needed to improve shell startup time.
-   [x] **Oh My Zsh Compatibility:** Install plugins directly from the Oh My Zsh repository.
-   [x] **CLI Tools:** A simple and intuitive command-line interface for managing your plugins.
-   [x] **One-Liner Installation:** A frictionless installation script for end-users.
